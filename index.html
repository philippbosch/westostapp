            <h1>West || Ost</h1>
            <p>
                Ever wandered around the city of Berlin, Germany, and wondered on which side of the Berlin Wall, which divided the city for nearly 30 years, you would be if it still existed? 
                <span class="app">West || Ost</span> is here to make you aware of that. It will tell you exactly one thing: if you are in the former western or eastern part of the city.
                And it vibrates your phone if you cross the former inner-city border.
            </p>
